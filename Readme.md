# How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MedtheVorg/ChatSphere--websocket-chat-app-.git

# Go into the server and the client folder
$ cd server  and cd client

# Install dependencies for both client and server folders
$ npm install

# Run the server (while inside the server folder)
$ npm start

# Run the client (while inside the client folder)
$ npm run dev
```

<br/>

# Features:

-   Real-Time Messaging : Send and receive messages to and from members of the chat room.
-   Multiple Chat Rooms: Choose from 5 chat rooms and start chatting instantly.
-   Message Broadcasting : Get notified whenever a member joins or leaves the chat room.
-   Message History : The chat room will store sent messages to a mongodb database and display the messages history whenever you join a room.

<br/>

# Process:

before starting this project I had no prior knowledge of websockets and how they work, I started by doing my research and understanding how they work and what is their primary purpose which is to enable a real-time communication through a full-duplex communication channel over a single long-lived connection.after that and using the socketio library I implemented what I learned to create a minimalistic chat app where a user can provide their name choose a chat room and start chatting.
<br/>

# Learnings:

during this project I learned about http polling and http streaming (half-duplex communication ) and how they can be used to mimic real-time communication. but they have certain drawbacks such as high latency and that is where websockets come to shine and provide full-duplex communication.
<br/>

# Improvement:

this project can be improved on by adding:

-   User Authentication and Authorization
-   Rich Media Support : allow users to send other multimedia content such as images, videos, audio and more.
-   Message Editing and Deletion: Enable users to edit or delete their messages, providing more control over the content they share.
-   Message Reactions : allow users to react to messages using emojis.
-   Status Indicators : Display users activity (online, away, offline)
